# AndroidFossSTTandKeyboard

This is my Foss setup to replace:
Gboard, Google Voice input, Gboard IME (STT Keyboard), Google TTS, Gboard with spell checker.  
Right now becaulse of the long dev cicle, I use HeliBoard becalse it also has a spellchecker,  
also even if you use florisboard you can still use HeliBoard for spellchecking,  
but it will only mark the words, not show any suggestions.

As mentioned right now i use HeliBoard,  
since spellchecking is not yet integrated into florisboard,  
is still usefull with with florisboard if you go that route,  
since it still marks words that are incorect:
